# BeeBright Local

A native desktop spelling practice app maintained, built and released entirely in this repository. No account, admin panel, or cloud progress database. Practice connects only to a server on this computer. Includes Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Multiple Choice, and Type the Word, with definitions, word origins, and sentences that hide the target spelling. Speech uses a voice installed on your computer.

## Windows install

In PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://beebright.vercel.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then run:

```text
beebright
```

The installer adds the command to your user PATH and installs an official signed Python 3.15.0 runtime under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BeeBright\runtime-3.15`, plus pywebview/Python.NET and Microsoft WebView2 when needed. No administrator privileges are required. Windows x64 is supported by this installer. You can review `install.ps1` before running it.

To update without opening the app, run:

```powershell
beebright update
```

It checks the latest verified package and preserves your local progress. An explicit update reports a connection failure instead of claiming success. Each normal launch also checks for an update. Packages are verified with SHA-256 and installed through a staging directory. On Windows 2.1, new packages have separate folders; a running app keeps its current files and the next launch uses the update. Previous packages remain until uninstall, so an open app is never broken by cleanup. If an older updater reports a Move-Item lock error, run the install command once to replace it. If the internet is unavailable, the installed app opens normally. Progress and settings live separately in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BeeBright\userdata` and survive updates. Installation and updates require internet; practice does not.

## macOS and Linux install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://beebright.vercel.app/install.sh | sh
```

The installer downloads Astral uv from its official source and installs a private Python 3.15 runtime, requiring no administrator access. It adds `~/.local/bin` to your bash or zsh profile. Open a new terminal and type `beebright`, or immediately use `~/.local/bin/beebright`. The same UI opens in your default browser; keep the terminal open and use Ctrl+C to stop. No pywebview, login or cloud storage is needed. Install `espeak` or `espeak-ng` for Linux offline speech. macOS uses its built-in `say` voice.

`beebright update`, `beebright web`, `beebright create web`, and all four version flags also work here. Verified updates preserve `~/.local/share/BeeBright/userdata`. Python, uv and the app live under `~/.local/share/BeeBright`; other Python installations stay separate.

## Open BeeBright in a browser

Open the public website:

```powershell
beebright web
```

Start a local browser edition, with no login or cloud features:

```powershell
beebright create web
```

It opens `http://beebright.localhost:8765/` and serves only this computer. Keep the terminal open while practicing; press Ctrl+C to stop. If the port is busy, BeeBright chooses the next available port and prints the address. If your browser cannot resolve the friendly name, use the printed `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` address. Chrome and Edge support localhost subdomains without editing your hosts file. This is a local server, not a published website. It uses the same bundled UI, hints, offline speech, theme, and progress files as the native app. Use one edition at a time so the most recent save does not overwrite another session.

To run this mode directly from the source ZIP, use `python -m beebright_local --web`. Optional: `--port 9000`.

## Run from source

Download the release ZIP, extract it, and use Python 3.15 and the desktop dependencies:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m beebright_local
```

On macOS, speech uses `say`; on Linux, install a pywebview GTK/Qt renderer and `espeak`. The terminal installer and verified updates support macOS and Linux too; their default UI opens in the browser.

## Local source and releases

`Dev-v1/beebright-local` is the authoritative source for this app. UI, tracks, Python code, offline data, installers and updates are maintained here. Website code is never imported or synchronized.

Build from this repository with `npm ci --prefix ui-source`, then `node tools/build-release.mjs`. This creates `dist/beebright-local-source.zip` and `dist/update-manifest.json`, using this repository's commit SHA. Run `node --test ui-source/src/*.test.js` and `python -m unittest discover -v`.

Every update to main runs the local tests and builds a new GitHub Release with the ZIP and its SHA-256 manifest. `beebright update` checks that release and installs its verified ZIP while preserving local players, progress and settings. It does not install a website build.

### Move an older installation to local-repository updates

Older launchers checked the website first. Run the original install command once to replace that launcher without deleting progress:

```powershell
irm https://beebright.vercel.app/install.ps1 | iex
```

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://beebright.vercel.app/install.sh | sh
```

After this one-time migration, use `beebright update` normally.

## License

BeeBright code and original content retain the website's Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. See `LICENSE`. Third-party dictionary adaptations retain their own attribution and license metadata, including CC BY-SA 4.0 for Wiktionary adaptations. Dictionary reference links are in the bundled hint records; original examples are labeled as such.

The old Tkinter window has been replaced by the shared website UI in a desktop WebView2 window. Practice does not connect to Clerk, Render, Neon, Google Fonts, or dictionary APIs. Attribution links open only when clicked. Earlier locally saved sessions are migrated. The old Python 3.13 runtime is not removed automatically; uninstall it through Windows Installed apps if it is no longer needed.

## Check the installed version

Run any of these in your terminal:

```powershell
beebright -v
beebright --v
beebright --version
beebright -version
```

Each prints the installed release, such as `BeeBright 2.0 (fixed)`, without opening the app or accessing the internet. Run `beebright update` separately to get the latest version.

The 2027 study list has 150 words in each of One Bee, Two Bee, and Three Bee. Each normal 2027 practice run includes all 150 in a shuffled order. Other lists use 100-question sets, and custom challenges keep their selected lengths.

## Commands

Run `beebright help` for descriptions of every command. Help and version checks work offline. `beebright update` installs the latest app and migrates older private runtimes to Python 3.15.

## BeeBright 2.0 commands

Type `beebright help` to list every command. Windows opens its desktop window; macOS and Linux open the same local UI in a browser.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `beebright daily` | Same ten words each UTC day |
| `beebright review` | Missed-word review |
| `beebright compete` | Elimination spelling bee |
| `beebright doctor` | Runtime, files, speech and data checks |
| `beebright stats` | Answer totals and accuracy |
| `beebright profile` | Open local players; also list, add NAME, switch NAME |
| `beebright backup` | Save all players to a timestamped JSON file in the current terminal directory; optional FILE.json |
| `beebright restore` | Open a backup picker; optional FILE.json |
| `beebright sprint` | Two-minute timed challenge |
| `beebright lists` | Lists, levels and completion |
| `beebright practice` | Custom session controls |
| `beebright audio` | Adjust and test speech |
| `beebright origins` | Practice by origin language |
| `beebright pairs` | Confusing word-pair lessons |
| `beebright favorites` | Practice saved words |
| `beebright worksheet` | Printable blanks and a separate answer key |
| `beebright remind` | Reminder controls; also HH:MM or off |
| `beebright achievements` | Practice milestones |
| `beebright duel` | Two players alternate turns |
| `beebright changelog` | Release notes |

Reminders work while the computer is awake and you are signed in. Reopen BeeBright after restarting to resume reminders. Example: `beebright remind 18:30`, and `beebright remind off` to stop. They do not require cloud services. Practice history is limited to the most recent 5,000 answers. Origin groups match language names in supplied histories; words can appear in several groups. List completion means a word has been answered correctly at least once, rather than a claim of permanent mastery.

Website practice tools save statistics and favorites in the current browser, separately for each account. Local profiles stay on the computer. The two backup formats are separate; neither exports Clerk credentials or website account data.

## Break arcade (2.1)

Normal practice offers optional 10-minute breaks after each 50 words and a 25-minute break on completing the set. Skip a break or end it early whenever you want. The timer continues while a game is paused or the window is hidden; expired breaks show a return button without forcing you into another question. Saved breaks retain their original deadline. Timed challenges are not interrupted.

The website has Sky Hopper, Sheep Escape, Gravity Flip, Pocket Bowling (five frames; pins count without strike/spare bonuses), and Neon Rally. Local editions also have Neon Dash with five original courses and optional original synthesized music, Marble Run 3D with three courses, and Space Survival 3D. Games have no learning tasks or bee themes. Keyboard and touch controls are included. Scores are saved per local player, or in the website browser for the signed-in account. No games require Render requests or game servers.

Three.js is MIT licensed; its license is included in the source ZIP. The two 3D games require WebGL 2. If unavailable, the six local 2D games still work. Graphics use low-poly meshes, no shadows, a 1.5x pixel-density cap and release GPU resources when leaving a game. The 3D engine loads only on demand. All original art and music are generated locally; there are no third-party music downloads.

## Racing tracks (2.7 fixed)

Neon Rally has twelve tracks. Choose a track and 1-10 laps on its game card before pressing Play. The original Harbor Circuit, Canyon Switchback, Alpine Hairpins and Midnight Metro are joined by:

| Track | Layout |
|---|---|
| Coastal Sprint | Sandy coast, palms, sweeping turns and long straights |
| Red Mesa Run | Terracotta mesas, cacti and alternating canyon bends |
| Pine Ridge | Autumn trees, golden verges and flowing ridge turns |
| Old Town Loop | Pastel houses, tiled roofs and tighter city corners |
| Summit Grand Prix | Blue snowfields and a 70-metre mountain climb |
| Sunset Docks | Warm sunset, cargo containers and dock cranes |
| Aurora Fjord | Green and violet Northern Lights above snowy forest climbs |
| Polar Night Pass | Purple polar sky, ice crystals and mountain bends |

All tracks support both graphics settings, four AI opponents and the cockpit/chase camera shortcut (R). The eight additions use slightly narrower 18-20 metre roads for a modest difficulty increase. Their scenery, stars and animated Northern Lights are generated locally and work offline.

## Uninstall

Close BeeBright and stop local browser practice with Ctrl+C, then run:

```text
beebright uninstall
```

This removes BeeBright, its private runtimes, terminal launcher, local saved progress and settings. Other Python installations, shared WebView2 and website account/progress remain. Back up your BeeBright `userdata` folder first if you want to retain progress. On Windows it is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BeeBright\userdata`; on macOS/Linux it is `~/.local/share/BeeBright/userdata`.
